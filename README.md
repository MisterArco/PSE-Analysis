# Philippine Stock Exchange Analysis

## Project Overview

The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is a vital component of the country's financial landscape, offering investors a platform to trade equities, bonds, and other securities. This project aims to conduct comprehensive analytics on PSE data to derive insights, trends, and patterns that can inform investment strategies, risk management decisions, and market behavior understanding.

This project will design and implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a suite of modern data engineering technologies. The pipeline will automate the extraction of data from various sources, transform it into a usable format, and load it into a cloud-based data warehouse for analysis. By leveraging these technologies, this aims to streamline data processing workflows, ensure data integrity, and enable efficient analytics and reporting.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, focusing on OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) stock data from the Philippines Stock Exchange. This dataset provides historical market information, including price movements and trading volumes for various stocks listed on the exchange. With this data, we aim to analyze trends and patterns to better understand the dynamics of the Philippine stock market
